# Repository Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments undertaken during the Parallel Computing Course (CS633) in the 6th semester at IITK, under the guidance of **Prof. Preeti Malakar**. The assignments were done in a group of 3 members.

## Assignments Overview:

### Assignment 1
Implemented halo-exchange along with 5 and 9-point stencil computations.

- **Grading:** Received 109.4/100 marks (94.4/100 + 15 marks bonus for early submission).

### Assignment 2
Compared and Analysed the performance of internode and intranode halo-exchange communications, along with 5 and 9-point stencil computations.

- **Grading:** Received 119/100 marks (93/100 + 15 marks bonus for early submission + 11 marks for bonus assignment). The bonus assignment involved running the code on HPC2010 cluster and analysing the observations.

**Note-** The assignments were evaluated subjectively, with report, coding practices and performance of the code having a component in evaluation along with testcases. The marks deducted were due to these subjective components rather than failure of code on testcases.
